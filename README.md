Abstract

That the dependency on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and increasingly on the Internet has made it essential to ensure cyber security in these systems. Cyber security vulnerabilities that may occur in information technologies used in energy systems carries the risks of stopping or failing of energy services, large-scale economic damage, disruption of public order, loss of life and even endangering the national security of the countries. The aim of this research is to outline cyber security concepts in energy systems, to investigate cyber attacks against energy systems, to reveal the importance of cyber security in critical infrastructures, especially the critical energy infrastructure managed by SCADA, and finally to increase current awareness. Descriptive method was employed in the research. The information obtained from the research shows that ensuring cyber security in energy systems is of vital importance. Among the suggestions made by the research, the importance of using national cyber security information technology products that have been subjected to national cyber security tests and developed and tested by national security institutions that both have accreditation and certification in the energy sector in Turkey was particularly emphasized.

Keywords: Energy Systems, Cyber Security, SCADA Systems, Critical Infrastructures
